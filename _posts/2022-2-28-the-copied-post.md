Nothing but grimly lit imperious silence. No emotions ran through that awful waiting cell but his own. 
No thoughts but those of which he could barely distinguis as his. he wasnt cuffed in fact he wasn't restrained at all.
He had no idea how they had gotten him into the room but there was only one way out. One terrible
awfully real and distinctly present way out. Three walls, smooth seamless steel sealed him in
from three sides, a thick black line running down the middle of the last wall betrayed it as the only exit or perhaps entrance was a better description. He knew where it led and he wanted anything but for those doors to open. Or perhaps he couldn't wait for them to open, desperate to begin the futile desperation, after all it was better than staying in this cell.

Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing
before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet;
and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it
requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping
into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I
account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute
for pistol and ball.

With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon
his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this.
If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,
cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
